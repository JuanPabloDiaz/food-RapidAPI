# Food - RapidAPI

Food - RapidAPI is a project that allows you to search for food and recipes using the Edamam Food and Grocery Database API.

## Consuming An API and Hide Your API Keys SAFELY in React

This is a simple app that consumes an API using React, Vite and
Tailwind CSS.

The App is secured using a key I created in Rapid API. This API key is saved in a `.env` file and the data is fetched
from a backend server that I created using Node.js and Express.js.

Since the app is getting the data from a backend server, the app
is only working in localhost when the backend server is up and
running. Which means that the app is not working in production yet.

To view the project on localhost, you need to run the backend
server first. Running the backend server is easy. Just run the
command `npm run backend` in the terminal. Then, run the command
`npm run dev` to start the app.

## Food API

The best food API for your app, website or recipe using Edamam Food and Grocery Database.
